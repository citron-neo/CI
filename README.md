# READ THIS IF YOU HAVE ISSUES

If you are on wayland (specially GNOME wayland) and get freezes or crashes, you are likely affected by this issue that affects all Qt6 apps: https://github.com/citron-neo/CI/issues/50

To fix it simply set the env variable `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`

**Also, are you looking for AppImages of other emulators? Check:** [AnyLinux-AppImages](https://pkgforge-dev.github.io/Anylinux-AppImages/) 

----

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks.

**These AppImages bundle everything and should work on any Linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

It is possible that the AppImages may fail to work with appimagelauncher, we recommend these alternatives instead: 

* [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) `am -i citron` or `appman -i citron`

* [dbin](https://github.com/xplshn/dbin) `dbin install citron.appimage`

* [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) `soar install citron`

These AppImages works without fuse2 as it can use fuse3 instead, it can also work without fuse at all thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime)

**The following information above and the creation of the AppImages Citron currently creates & distributes derives from Pkgforges previous work. You can find their repository here: https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/Citron-AppImage**
